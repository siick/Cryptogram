# Cryptogram
A "small little tiny" tool to encrypt text (and more on future version!)

Right now, Cryptogram is just a basic tool in C# that encrypt/decrypt text with a password using AES encryption.
For the future i want to add : 
- The encryption/decryption of a .txt file into another .txt file
- The encryption/decryption of files (no matter the type)
- The import/export/creation of GPG Key.
- The encryption/decryption of plain text using GPG Key.

I also want to make it in Java to make Cryptogram runs on every platform and i also want to make an Android app.
Every helpers are welcome, this is my first program.
